* Xprinter WiFi

  [[file:screenshot.png]]

  This tool allows you to setup the WiFi on a wireless Xprinter
  thermal receipt printer on Linux, without the use of the official
  Windows-only setup tool.

  To use it, plug your thermal printer into a USB port and determine
  it's device file. For example =/dev/usb/lp0=. From there you just
  have to run =ruby xprinter-wifi.rb /dev/usb/lp0= and it should
  prompt you for the values required.

  This script was created as part of a [[https://blog.lambda.cx/posts/xprinter-wifi/][blog post]] about reverse
  engineering thermal printer setup commands.
