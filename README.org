* Xprinter WiFi

  [[file:screenshot.png]]

  This tool allows you to setup the WiFi on a wireless Xprinter
  thermal receipt printer on Linux, without the use of the official
  Windows-only setup tool.

  To use it, plug your thermal printer into a USB port and determine
  it's device file. For example =/dev/usb/lp0=. From there you just
  have to run =ruby xprinter-wifi.rb= and it should prompt you for the
  values required.
